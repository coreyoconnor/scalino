# Compiles the patched vendor/scala3 (+ vendor/scala-native nscplugin/nir/util)
# self-hosted source set to plain JVM .class files, using the published,
# unpatched scala3-compiler_3 jar as the executing compiler. Needed only so
# build/02b-gen-megaphase-overrides.sh's reflection scan can see MiniPhase
# subclasses this project's own patches add (e.g.
# transform/CollectEntryPoints.scala, patches/scala3-0006) -- those never
# exist in the published jar, only in the patched source tree, so scanning
# the published jar alone (what 02b did on its own, pre-2026-09-13) silently
# omits them: MegaPhase.defines' generated lookup table then has no entry for
# them, and any self-hosted binary crashes the first time it actually fuses
# phases (`MiniPhaseOverrides has no entry for ...`).
#
# This step exists because build/selfhost/build-dotc.sh, an earlier opt-in
# GraalVM-native-image-era script, used to do this same reflection-discovery
# compile (leftover evidence: the now-orphaned, stale-3.8.4-pinned
# .build-work/compiler-patched.cp / compiler-sources.cp files) but was
# deleted in the 2026-09-07 self-host cutover (commit 94851ee) without this
# capability being carried over into the new 02b script. Restored here as
# its own step so it's easy to find again.
#
# Note this is a *plain JVM* compile, not a Scala Native/NIR one: it uses the
# real published scala3-compiler_3 jar's own already-loaded GenBCode backend
# to emit real, reflectable .class bytecode (this project's own
# vendor/scala3 patches Nil out `backendPhases` only in the source *files*
# being compiled here -- that has zero effect on the already-running compiler
# process actually doing the compiling). backend/jvm/backend/sjs sources are
# still excluded from the input (see build/selfhost/gen-file-list.sh's own
# comment) purely because they'd need a real org.scala-lang.modules:scala-asm
# dependency to compile as *source*, which nothing here needs.
